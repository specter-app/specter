# Project Name #
Specter

## Heading ##
Create and discover the world's secret stash.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Specter transforms physical reality into a communication platform by letting anyone create and discover public, private, and time-sensitive location-based digital caches.

## Summary ##
  > Specter is a digital geocaching app that turns the city into a treasure trove of crowdsourced discovery and exploration. You can turn the city into an exploration engine by contributing clues, puzzles, photos, or other digital geocached items for others to discover. As you walk around the city, your screen will turn redder as you get farther from a digicached item, and bluer as you get closer to a digiached item; once you’re in range, you can either collect the item if it’s unlocked, or, if it’s locked, solve a riddle or other clue to unlock it. Anyone can use the platform to create their own scavenger hunt, Cicada 3301, group game, or secret event listing.

## Problem ##
  > Physical reality is defined and limited – what you see is what you get.
  > The age of technology has diminished interaction between strangers in the physical world. People no longer have a way to communicate a meaningful message to each other that takes place in their city.


## Solution ##
  > Specter combines the physical and virtual reality into a whole new dimensions for you to explore and augment. Specter turns physical reality into an infinite exploration of people’s imagination by leveraging digital multimedia.

## Quote from You ##
